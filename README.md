# AdPost-Gen üìùü§ñ

**AdPost-Gen** is a promotional post generator for social media.  
It uses a lightweight generative language model (LLM) to produce text, applies summarization-based quality control, and performs ethical filtering. A simple UI is provided via Streamlit.

---

## üìå Project Description

- Generates short promotional posts (~50‚Äì100 tokens) based on a given topic
- Allows users to select tone (`formal`, `friendly`, `funny`) and emoji preference
- Uses summarization and semantic similarity for quality checking
- Applies basic and optional ML-based ethical filtering (toxicity)
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit

---

## üßæ User Input

- **Subject of the ad** ‚Äì short topic like `"discount on coffee"`, `"new online course"`
- **Tone** ‚Äì one of: `formal`, `friendly`, `funny`
- **Emoji** ‚Äì `with emoji` or `no emoji`
- **Language** ‚Äì English (only for prototype)

Prompt example:
> *"Write a funny advertisement post in English about a discount on coffee. Add emojis to make it more engaging."*

## üß± Pipeline Architecture

The system follows this pipeline:

1. **User Input**  
   User provides:  
   - subject of the ad  
   - tone (formal/friendly/funny)  
   - emoji option  
   - language (English)

2. **Prompt Construction**  
   The inputs are combined into a structured prompt.

3. **Text Generation**  
   The prompt is passed to `distilgpt2` via Hugging Face `transformers.generate()`.

4. **Summarization-Based Quality Control**  
   The generated output is summarized using `t5-small` or `bart-base`, and its relevance to the original prompt is measured using cosine similarity.

5. **Ethical Filtering**  
   The generated post is checked for toxic content using a basic keyword filter and optionally a `text-classification` pipeline.

6. **Final Output via UI**  
   The clean, high-quality ad post is displayed to the user through a Streamlit web interface.
